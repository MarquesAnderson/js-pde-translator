# js-pde-translator
Parts of a simple translator to turn JavaScript files into Processing files. Given some structural similarities between the languages and my previous use of both for similar projects, I wanted to experiment with a translation algotrithm. 

Part 1 is a basic translator for variable declarations, where I attempt to find a variable's declaration and determine what data type the variable is.
